ðŸš€ Day 5 of Building a Coffee Ordering Website ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to share that I've completed a coffee ordering website today!

The website features:

Header with Navigation Bar: Includes Home, Product, Testimonial, About Us, and Contact Us sections.
A user-friendly interface to explore and order coffee products.
Check out my progress and code on GitHub.

Stay tuned for more updates!
